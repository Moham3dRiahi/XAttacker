This man is a scammer, don't pay him for so-called tools.
They don't exist. He accepts payments through a cryptocurrency wallet, so you can't get your money back.
I have almost nothing left from the evidence, except a confirmation of crypto voucher activation from a location similar to this user's home location.
There is also an IP address. In his telegram channel he often publishes various discounts,
which allegedly reduce the cost, but it makes no sense because it is a fraud.
